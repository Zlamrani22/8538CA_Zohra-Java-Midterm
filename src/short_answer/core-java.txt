***ANSWER ALL OF THE QUESTIONS BELOW***

What is a programming language?
Answer:
A programming language is a vocabulary and set of grammatical rules for instructing a computer or computing
device to perform specific tasks.

What is a JDK composed of? Define each component?
Answer:
JDK stands for Java Development Kit. It is the tool necessary to compile, document and package Java programs.
It contains JRE and development tools.
1- JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment and refers to a runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed.
JRE is an implementation of the JVM which physically exists.
2- Development tools: Java development tools include different tools such as: javac (a compiler),
java ( launcher for Java applications), javap (class file disassembler), jdb (java debugger), and others.
    - Java compiler (javac) is used to convert Java text file into an executable program. Java text segment converted
    into bytecode after compilation which carries the .class extension.
    - Java interpreter or loader converts each program statement into the machine code. This includes source code,
    pre-compiled code, and scripts. The difference from a compiler is that compilers will convert the code into machine
     code (create an exe) before program run and interpreters convert code into machine code when the program is run.
    - Java archiver (jar) is the most popular after javac is the jar tool. The jar file is nothing but a full pack
    of Java classes. After creating the .class files, you can put them together in a .jar, which compresses and
    structures them in a predictable fashion.

What is an IDE?
Answer:
An IDE, which stands for Integrated Development Environment, is a program that helps write software. An IDE helps also
 organize software projects, write code, test and debug.

What are some of the most popular Java IDEs available in the market?
Answer:
Some popular Java IDEs are Eclipse, Visual Studio Code, NetBeans, IntelliJ IDEA, JDeveloper.

Explain the entire java life cycle.
Answer:
There are three main stages in the life cycle of a java program, which are:
    Editing the program
    Compiling the source code
    Executing the byte code
First, the user starts with typing the program in a text-editor, like notepad or such. After completing editing of the
program, the file needs to be saved with .java extension.
Second step is compilation. The input to the compiler is Java source code .java. The output of the compiler is bytecode.
The file which is generated after compilation is .class file.
Last step is execution. The bytecode generated by the compiler will be executed by Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Input to
the JVM is bytecode and output is machine code (0’s and 1’s) which will be executed by the CPU of the local machine.

What is a class?
Answer:
A class is a blueprint or representation of a real-world object.
A class contains variables and methods to describe the behavior of an object.

What is an object?
Answer:
in Java, an object is a real-world entity that has states and behaviors. Any object can be described using its
attributes/characteristics and methods/behaviors that object can perform.

What is the entry point of a Java project?
Answer:
An entry point is a point in a program where the execution of a program begins, and where the program has access to
command line arguments, the main method is the entry point of a Java application, which is public static void main(String[])

Why is the main() method static?
Answer:
In any Java program, the main() method is the starting point from where the compiler starts program execution. Because
of that Java main() method is always static, so the compiler can call it without the creation of an object or before
the creation of an object of the class.

Which class is the superclass of all classes?
Answer:
Java's super-class is the Object class, which is stored in java.lang package.

What is difference between path and classpath variables?
Answer:
1- PATH is an environment variable. It is used by operating system to find the executable files (.exe) or in other words
java binaries (java or javac), and CLASSPATH is also an environment variable used by Application ClassLoader to locate
and load the .class files(compiled java bytecodes).
2- In order to set PATH,  JDK_HOME/bin directory needs to be included in PATH environment variable.
In order to set CLASSPATH, we need to include all the directories which contain .class files and jar files  as
required by the application.
3- PATH environment variable once set, its value cannot be overridden via java settings. However, CLASSPATH environment
variable can be overridden by using the command line option -cp or -classpath to both javac and java commands.
4- PATH is used by operating system(Windows and Linux) to execute command in the shell or to find any binary, when
CLASSPATH is only used by Application CLASSLOADER to load class files.

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
Answer:
1- abstract keyword is used to create an abstract class, and it also can be used with methods; whereas interface keyword
is used to create interface, and cannot be used with methods.
2- Subclasses use extends keyword to extend an abstract class, and need to provide implementation of all the declared
methods in the abstract class unless the subclass is also an abstract class; whereas subclasses use implements keyword
to implement interfaces and should provide implementation for all the methods declared in the interface.
3- Abstract classes can have methods with implementation; whereas interfaces provide absolute abstraction and cannot
have any method implementations.
4- Abstract classes can have constructors but interfaces cannot have constructors.
5- Abstract class have all the features of a normal java class except that they cannot be instantiated, the abstract
keyword can be used to make a class abstract but interfaces are a completely different and can have only public static
final constants and method declarations.
6- Abstract class methods can have access modifiers as public, private, protected, static but interface methods are
implicitly public and abstract, no other access modifiers with interface methods can be used.
7- A subclass can only extend one abstract class, but it can implement multiple interfaces.
8- Abstract classes can extend other class and implement interfaces, but interface can only extend other interfaces.
9- An abstract class can be run if it has a main() method, but an interface cannot because it cannot have main
method implementation.

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class? If yes or no, how would you do it?
Answer:
- Interface: no, we cannot instantiate an interface, it contains abstract methods which all need to be defined in
the class. To access the members of an interface we need to implement it and provide implementation to all its
abstract methods.
- Abstract class: no, we cannot instantiate an abstract class either, because it is abstract, which means it is not
complete, therefore it cannot be used. To implement features of an abstract class, we inherit subclasses from it and
create objects of the subclass. A subclass must override all abstract methods of an abstract class.

What is Access Modifier?
Answer:
Access modifiers are special keywords which are used to restrict the access of a class, constructor, data member and
method in another class.
Java supports four types of access modifiers:
    Default - no keyword required.
    Private
    Protected
    Public

What is OOP? Define each OOP concept.
Answer:
OOP stand for Object-Oriented Programming, OOP concepts include abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and
polymorphism. Basically, the OOP concepts let us create working methods and variables, then re-use all or part of
them without compromising security.
1- Abstraction: abstraction is the process of hiding or covering certain details or the internal process and
showing only essential information to the user.
2- Encapsulation: encapsulation is data hiding. In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other
classes, and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class.
To achieve encapsulation, the variables of a class need to be declared as private. And to modify and view the variables
values, we need to provide public getter and setter methods.
3- Inheritance: inheritance can be defined as the process where one class acquires the properties (methods and fields)
of another class. The class which inherits the properties of other is known as subclass, derived class, or child
class and the class whose properties are inherited is known as superclass, base class, or parent class.
Inheritance is used when we have IS-A relationship between objects, and is implemented using extends keyword.
4- Polymorphism: polymorphism is the ability of an object to take many forms. Polymorphism allows us to perform the
same action in different ways. Polymorphism occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other
by inheritance.
Polymorphism is of two types:
    - Compile-time polymorphism (method overloading)
    - Runtime polymorphism(method overriding)

What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
Answer:
In Java, packages are the collection of related classes and interfaces which are bundled together. By using packages,
developers can easily modularize the code and optimize its reuse. Also, the code within the packages can be imported
by other classes and reused.
The use of packages help in avoiding name clashes, provide easier access control on the code, can contain hidden
classes which are not visible to the outer classes and only used within the package, and create a proper hierarchical
structure which makes it easier to locate the related classes.
java. lang package is imported by default.

What is an API? List some API's that you have used so far.
Answer:
API stands for Application Programming Interface.
An API is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. In
other words, an API is the messenger that delivers our request to the provider that we are
requesting it from and then delivers the response back to us.

Does java support multiple inheritance? Why or why not?
Answer:
No, Java does not support multiple inheritance.
The problem with multiple inheritance is that if multiple parent classes have the same method name, then at runtime it
becomes difficult for the compiler to decide which method to execute from the child class. Therefore, Java does not
support multiple inheritance.

What is method overloading? List all of the different ways to overload.
Answer:
Overloading occurs when two or more methods in one class have the same method name but different parameters.
Method Overloading is a compile-time polymorphism.
In Method Overloading, Methods of the same class shares the same name but accepting:
    - different number of parameters;
    - different data types of parameters or
    - different order of parameters (different data type and different order).
Method Overloading is to “add” or “extend” more to the method’s behavior, the methods must have a different signature.

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle them.
Answer:
an exception in java is an event that disrupts the normal flow of the program. It is an object which is thrown at runtime.
exception handling however, is a mechanism to handle runtime errors such as ClassNotFoundException, IOException,
SQLException, RemoteException, etc.
The try-catch is the simplest method of handling exceptions. We put the code we want to run in the try block, and any
exception that the code throws are caught by one or more catch blocks.
This method will catch any type of Java exceptions that get thrown.
We can also specify specific exceptions we would like to catch, this allows us to have dedicated code to recover from
those errors and treat those conditions separately.
In addition, any code that must be executed irrespective of occurrence of an exception is put in a finally block.
A finally block is executed in all circumstances.

What is static keyword? When and how do we use it?
Answer:
The static keyword is a non-access modifier that is applicable for blocks, variables, methods, and classes.
Static means unchanging or not changeable, which means we can change the value of it but the place in memory remains
static. It is mainly used for memory management, once we re-assign a value to the original, the old value is garbage.
Static is used when a particular piece of code is to be shared by all the instance methods, and it is also used to share
the same variable or method of a given class.
Static is also used for constant variables or methods that are the same for every instance of the class.
The way the static keyword is used is by creating a static member, either a block, a variable, a method, or a nested
class, and precede its declaration with the keyword static.

What is final keyword? When and how do we use it?
Answer:
The final keyword is a non-access specifier that is used to restrict a class, variable, and method.
If we initialize a variable with the final keyword, then we cannot modify its value.
If we declare a method as final, then it cannot be overridden by any subclasses.
And, if we declare a class as final, we restrict the other classes to inherit or extend it. In other words, the final
classes can not be inherited by other classes.
The final keyword is used when declaring an entity, which could be a variable, a class, or a method. Using the final
keyword prevents value from being modified. Technically, the final keyword is used when we want a variable to
always store the same value.

Explain the difference between final, finally and finalize?
Answer:
1- Definition: final is a keyword and access modifier that is used to apply restrictions on a class, method or variable;
finally is the block of Exception Handling to execute the important code whether the exception occurs or not. However,
finalize is the method that is used to perform clean up processing just before object is garbage collected.
2- Applicable to: Final keyword is used with classes, methods and variables;
finally block is always related to the try and catch block in exception handling; and
finalize() method is used with the objects.
3- functionality: with final keyword:
    - Once declared, final variable becomes constant and cannot be modified.
    - final method cannot be overridden by a subclass.
    - final class cannot be inherited.
Using finally:
    - finally block runs the important code even if exception occurs or not.
    - finally block cleans up all the resources used in try block
finalize method, however performs the cleaning activities with respect to the object before its destruction.
4- Execution: the final method is executed only when we call it;
finally block is executed as soon as the try-catch block is executed, and Its execution is not dependent on the exception.
finalize method is executed just before the object is destroyed.

What is a constructor?
Answer:
A constructor refers to a block of code which is used to initialize an object. It must have the same name as
that of the class. Also, it has no return type, and it is automatically called when an object is created.

Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
Answer:
Yes, a class can have multiple constructors, however, it is not possible to have 2 constructors with the same parameters.
The technique of having multiple constructors in a class is known as constructor overloading.

If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
Answer:
The default constructor is called, because all classes have constructors, whether we define one or not, Java
automatically provides a default constructor that initializes all member variables to zero. However, once we define
our own constructor, the default constructor is no longer used.

What is "this" keyword in Java? When would we use it?
Answer:
In Java, "this" is a keyword.
It is a reference variable that refers to current object of a method or constructor.
We would use it:
    - to refer current class instance variables;
    - to invoke or initiate current class constructor;
    - to pass it as an argument in the method call;
    - to pass as argument in the constructor call;
    - to return the current class instance.

What is "super" keyword in Java? What are some scenarios we would use it?
Answer:
in Java, the super keyword is a reference variable that refers to an immediate parent class object.
When we create a subclass instance, we are also creating an instance of the parent class, which is referenced to by
the super reference variable.
The uses of the super Keyword:
    - To refer to an immediate parent class instance variable;
    - The keyword super can be used to call the method of an immediate parent class;
    - Super() can be used to call the constructor of the immediate parent class.

What does JVM stand for?

Answer:
JAR stands for Java ARchive.

What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
Answer:
- JDK is Java Development Kit, and JVM is Java Virtual Machine;
- JDK is a software development kit to develop applications in Java, but JVM executes Java byte code and provides an
environment for executing it. This means that the JDK is what we need to compile Java source code, whereas, the JVM
actually runs Java bytecode.
- JDK contains tools for developing, debugging, and monitoring java code, however Software development tools are
not included in JVM;
- JDK enables developers to create Java programs that can be executed and run by the JRE and JVM, when JVM is the Java
platform component that executes source code;
- JDK comes with the installer, but JVM bundled in both software JDK and JRE.

What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
Answer:
- JVM is an engine that provides a runtime environment to drive the Java Code or applications, it converts Java bytecode
into machine language. JVM is a part of Java Run Environment (JRE), it cannot be separately downloaded and installed.
In order to install JVM, we need to install JRE;
- JVM is an environment for executing bytecode, whereas JRE is a software bundle that allows Java program to run;
- JRE contains class libraries and other supporting files, whereas software development tools are not included in JVM;
- JRE contains class libraries and other supporting files that JVM requires to execute the program, whereas JVM is
bundled in the JRE software;
- JRE is the subset of JDK, but JVM is the subset of JRE.
